- Hi, I'm Alena, a curious mind with a passion for efficiency and optimization.  
- I’m currently learning software testing and relevant tools (SQL, Git, Linux etc.). You can check my current CV here: https://github.com/Alena-Stavrova/qa-cv-portfolio.
- I’d be happy to collaborate on projects as a junior software tester. I'm particularly interested in working in an agile team. 
- My other interests include, but are not limited to: playing violin, weightlifting, cooking, learning German on Duolingo and MBTI memes.
